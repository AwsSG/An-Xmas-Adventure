##### BFXR
We used BFXR to generate the games sounds effects. BFXR is a free tool by Stephen Lavelle that generates retro style sound effects and allows them to be exported to various file formats. The UI consists of mixers, dials and buttons that allow easy customisation of waveforms, pitch, reverb and arpeggiation amongst other effects. The tool is used widely in the retro game development community and the assets created from it are licence free. BFXR is packaged as a downloadable executable.
The software can be downloaded at https://www.bfxr.net/

##### Tiled
We used Tiled by Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer to create our level maps. Tiled is a 2D level editor that helps create tile maps of various forms. It supports straight rectangular tile layers, but also projected isometric, staggered isometric and staggered hexagonal layers. A tile set can be either a single image containing many tiles, or it can be a collection of individual images. In order to support certain depth faking techniques, tiles and layers can be offset by a custom distance and their rendering order can be configured. Tiled also allows layering of tile maps meaning we were able to create a collision layer for Santa to interact with as well as a decoration layer to enhance the background graphics detail.
Tiled is free and available at https://www.mapeditor.org/
